                        <b class="scholarship-subtitle">§ 1 Duration</b><br>
                        The Participant will receive a scholarship for the time from {{batchTime}} as support during
                        their participation in the DPS programme. The purpose of the grant is a monthly
                        financial support in the amount of {{monthlyAmount}}.<br><br>

                        <b class="scholarship-subtitle">§ 2 Obligations</b><br>
                        The Student will participate in the DPS programme at the UnternehmerTUM GmbH and undertakes to
                        complete it successfully. The Student is not employed by the company at the time of the program.
                        The Participant is not participating in the DPS programme as a freelancer to use UnternehmerTUM
                        as regular occupation but rather takes part at for education reasons. The Student has to ensure
                        a proper internet connection with at least a real bandwidth of 10 Mbit/s in download and 2
                        Mbit/s upload.<br><br>

                        <b class="scholarship-subtitle">§ 3 Total sum granted/Procedure for payments</b><br>
                        (1) The student will be granted a scholarship amounting to a total of {{totalAmount}}.<br><br>

                        (2) Payment will be effected in three monthly rates of {{monthlyAmount}} at the end of each
                        month of participation (latest at the second workday of the following month) to the following
                        bank account:<br><br>

                        IBAN: <b>{{iban}}</b><br>
                        BIC: <b>{{bic}}</b><br>
                        Name of bank: <b>{{bankName}}</b><br>
                        Name of account holder: <b>{{accountHolder}}</b><br><br>

                        (3) For bank transfers to banks or bank accounts outside the European Union, UnternehmerTUM has
                        to charge the participant a transfer fee of 15.00 euros per transfer (which means
                        for 3 transfers 45.00 euros in total). The transfer fee will be directly subtracted from the
                        monthly scholarship before the payment is transferred. This fee reduces the effective payment
                        to {{bankAmount}} per transaction.<br>
                        Be aware that your bank might apply transfer fees, too, that will further decrease your
