 (1) This Agreement shall govern the participation of the Participant in the programme of the Digital Product School, which shall be organised by UnternehmerTUM in conjunction with partners specified in the Programme Description (the "Partners") and the scope of which shall extend to the conceptualisation and implementation of development projects to address particular issues/tasks (each individually a "DPS Project" and collectively the "DPS Projects").

 <b class="participation-subtitle">Section 2 <br> Intellectual property </b><br>
 (1) All work products, know-how and/or intellectual property resulting from the participation of the Participant in the DPS programme or developed by the latter – for example, and in particular, data, designs, inventions, software and firmware, documents, derivative proprietary rights and any existing rights of use (hereinafter referred to as the "Foreground") – shall be attributed solely to UnternehmerTUM. This does not concern any of the Participant’s work products, know-how and/or intellectual property that are developed by Participant after and/or outside the DPS programme, provided that such work products, know-how and/or intellectual property do not partly or in whole consist of and/or are not based upon any Back- and/or Foreground and/or have been developed without technical equipment and/or software products provided to Participant by UnternehmerTUM and/or the Partners solely for the participation in DPS.

 (2) To the extent legally permissible, the Participant hereby assigns all of his/her rights of ownership and use with regard to such Foreground to UnternehmerTUM.<br><br>
 (3) Should the transfer of any part of the Foreground prove not to be possible by operation of law, the Participant shall, on a gratuitous basis, confer upon UnternehmerTUM the exclusive, geographically, temporally and substantively unlimited, and freely transferable and/or sub-licensable right to exercise all of the rights of use and exploitation, ancillarycopyrights and other rights in relation to the part of the Foreground in question existing upon the conclusion of the Agreement or arising at a future point in time. This shall comprise, but not be limited to, the following types of use in particular: <br><br>
 <ul>
         <li>The right to duplicate the subject matter of the aforementioned right or parts thereof and to make it available to the public in all physical and non-physical forms and media, whether existing or to be developed in the future;</li>
         <li>The right to process or otherwise alter the subject matter of the aforementioned right or parts thereof, and the right to itself use the resultant product in any of the contractually stipulated forms.</li>
 </ul>

 (4) The Participant warrants that he/she shall take necessary action to ensure the timely and complete transfer of any proprietary rights, having regard, in particular, to the provisions of the German Act on Copyright and Related Rights (Gesetz über Urheberrecht und verwandte Schutzrechte – UrhG) and the rules of procedure and/or regulations imposed by national and supranational authorities in relation to the registration of intellectual property rights. The Participant shall not take any action which would prejudice the transfer in a proper manner of proprietary rights by UnternehmerTUM and/or one/more third parties designated by UnternehmerTUM.<br><br>
