                        {{postcode}}, {{city}}, {{country}}<br /><br />

                        hereinafter Participant.<br /><br />

                        According its corporate charter Digital Product School is permitted to grant scholarships.<br /><br />

                        <b> § 1 Duration</b><br>
                        The Participant will receive a scholarship for the time from September 14, 2021 to December 3 2021 as support during
                        their participation in the Digital Product School. The purpose of the grant is a monthly financial support in the amount
                        of 750.00 euros.<br><br>

                        <b>§ 2 Obligations</b><br>
                        The Student will participate in the Digital Product School at the UnternehmerTUM GmbH and
                        undertakes to complete it successfully. The Student is not employed by the company at the time of the program. The
                        Student is not participating in the program as a freelancer to use Digital Product School as regular occupation but
                        rather takes part at for education reasons. The Student has to ensure a proper internet connection with at least a real
                        bandwidth of 10 Mbit/s in download and 2 Mbit/s upload.<br><br>

                        <b>§ 3 Total sum granted/Procedure for payments</b><br>
                        (1) The student will be granted a scholarship amounting to a total of 2,250.00 euros.<br><br>
                        
                        (2) Payment will be effected in three monthly rates of 750.00 euros at the end of each month of participation (latest at
                        the second workday of the following month) to the following bank account:<br><br>
                        
                        IBAN: {{iban}}<br>
                        BIC: {{bic}}<br>
                        Name of bank: {{bankName}}<br>
                        Name of account holder: {{accountHolder}}<br><br>
                        
                        (3) For bank transfers to banks or bank accounts outside the European Union, Digital Product School has to charge the
                        participant a transfer fee of 15.00 euros per transfer (which means for 3 transfers 45.00 euros in total). The transfer
                        fee will be directly subtracted from the monthly scholarship before the payment is transferred. This fee reduces the
                        effective payment to 735.00 euros per transaction.<br>
                        Be aware that your bank might apply transfer fees, too, that will further decrease your available amount.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>§ 4 Taxes/Social security contributions</b><br>
                        The Participant is solely responsible for adherence to regulations regarding the German tax law and the German social
                        security system. It is the Participant's responsibility to ensure they have adequate health insurance.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>§ 5 Obligation regarding notification of sponsorship through
                        Digital Product School</b><br>
                        In the event of publication of papers, conference agendas, contributions to conferences, essays etc., the Participant is
                        obliged to quote, orally and in writing, Digital Product School as their sponsor.<br><br>

                        <b> § 6 Liability</b><br>
                        The Participant is liable for any damage due to negligence: They are responsible for the necessary insurance cover.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>§ 7 Termination</b><br>
                        (1) This contract can be terminated for good cause. This includes among other things<br>
                        - if one of the decisive requirements for the granting of the scholarship no longer applies,<br>
                        - major breach of contract,<br>
                        - if the Participant obviously fails to commit themselves to achieving the agreed target, e.g. absence without valid
                        excuse, lack of active participation during tuition or in project work.<br>
                        - if the Participant can’t ensure a sufficient internet connection for a trouble-free communication, e.g. essential
                        video calls without any stocking, interruptions, and latency.<br><br>
                        
                        (2) In the event that the agreement is terminated on the grounds of the Participant’s conduct, then payments that have
                        already been granted are to be reimbursed.<br><br>
